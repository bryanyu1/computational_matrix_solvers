Analyzing the performance of the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods for solving matrices.

I created two functions that utilized the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods in MATLAB; these are included in the files of GSeidel.m and Jacobi.m respectively.  Thereafter, I decided to test how these two methods compared to each other. I investigated the relative error of each method's solutions in relation to the value of n (the number of iterations); this is summarized in create_table.mlx. Furthermore, I also explored the runtimes associated with each method as seen in the runtime.mlx file.
